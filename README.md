# GitHub Profile Picture Generator

### This is a project I made for fun, it's a python program that generates random Github profile pictures
### When someone create an account, I don't know if the profile picture is generated or picked from a list but if it's from a list, then this could be used to give more variety

## Usage
Download the latest release from the release page.
And run the file from command line like this
```bash
pfp-gen.exe --h
```
This will show the help menu about arguments for the app

You can use `--show` to generate and show the image

Or you can use `--save` to save the generated image

You can also use both arguments
