# GitHub Profile Picture Generator

### This is a project I made for fun, it's a python program that generates random Github profile pictures
### When someone create an account, I don't know if the profile picture is generated or picked from a list but if it's from a list, then this could be used to give more variety

## Usage
Download the source code and run the file from command line like this
```bash
python main.py --arguments
```
( This script uses PIL and Argparse install them with ```pip install pillow; argparse``` if you don't have them )

Use `--h` to see the help menu about arguments for the app (```python main.py --h```)

You can use `--show` to generate and show the image

Or you can use `--save` to save the generated image

You can also use both arguments
